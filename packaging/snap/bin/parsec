# This was a hot fix from 2019 for a segfault with ubuntu 18
# See https://github.com/Scille/parsec-cloud/issues/162 for more information.
# This is likely why we don't have native dialogs on linux with snap.
# Update 2022: we're removing this hot fix and hope for the best.
# Good news is we should be able to have native dialogs with snap builds.
# If any segfaults happen on some linux distro, we should try to restore it and see if it helps.

# SNAP env variable is used by Qt to determine we are within a sandbox
# and hence should use xdg-desktop-portal. However this is broken
# (see https://github.com/Scille/parsec-cloud/issues/702) so we bypass this
# and fallback to xdg-open which is fine given we use snap in classic mode
# (i.e. without sandbox).
